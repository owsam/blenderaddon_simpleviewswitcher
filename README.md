I made this simple addon for Blender to help the view navigation esp. when I use Blender with small laptop which doesn't have num keys.
you can change settings to option which you would like to show the tool, on the header or side-bar. This code is generated by Chat-GPT, so it's tottally free to use and change as your wish :) Let me know if you can update this more useful one!
